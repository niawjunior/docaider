## Summary of Changes

DocAider has been successfully refactored to focus exclusively on Knowledge Management and Retrieval-Augmented Generation capabilities. The application now provides a streamlined experience for users to:

1. Upload and process documents into a knowledge base
2. Query their knowledge base using natural language
3. Receive AI-generated responses based on their documents
4. Manage their knowledge repository efficiently

All non-KM/RAG features such as web search, weather data, text-to-speech, and data visualization have been removed from both the UI and backend code, resulting in a more focused and specialized application.
