# DocAider

An AI-powered Knowledge Management and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that helps users build, manage, and query their knowledge base using natural language processing and semantic search.

## Features

- üîç **Semantic Search**: Find relevant information using natural language queries or keywords
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Knowledge Retrieval**: Get AI-generated answers from your document repository
- üè∑Ô∏è **Smart Knowledge Organization**: Automatically process and structure information from documents
- üìä **Knowledge Analytics**: Track usage and identify gaps in your knowledge base
- üîÑ **Context-Aware Responses**: Understands technical jargon and domain-specific terminology
- üîê **Secure & Private**: Enterprise-grade security with role-based access control
- üöÄ **Fast & Scalable**: Built for performance with efficient vector search capabilities

## Key Features

### 1. Document Analysis & Q&A

- **Ask Questions**: Get precise answers from your uploaded documents
- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant information using natural language queries
- **Document Management**: View and organize all your uploaded documents in one place
- **Context-Aware Responses**: AI understands document context for accurate answers

### 2. Knowledge Base Creation

- **Document Processing**: Upload and process various document formats (PDF, CSV, TXT, DOCX)
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Automatically extract key information from documents
- **Knowledge Organization**: Structure and categorize information for efficient retrieval
- **Multilingual Support**: Process and understand documents in multiple languages

### 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation

- **Source Attribution**: Identify which documents provided the information
- **Confidence Scoring**: Understand the reliability of generated responses
- **Knowledge Gaps Identification**: Identify areas where more information is needed

### 4. Vector Database Integration

- **Efficient Storage**: Store document embeddings for fast retrieval
- **Semantic Matching**: Match queries to the most relevant document sections
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handle growing knowledge bases with ease
- **Real-time Updates**: Update knowledge base with new information seamlessly

### 5. Knowledge Analytics

- **Usage Insights**: Track which documents are most frequently queried
- **Knowledge Coverage**: Identify strengths and gaps in your knowledge base
- **Query Patterns**: Understand what information users seek most often
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor response quality and retrieval accuracy
